# Summary overview of the allowed functions:

## **Readline and History Functions**

readline: Reads a line of input from the user with line-editing features (arrows, history navigation).

rl_clear_history: Clears all the lines stored in the Readline history.

rl_on_new_line: Tells Readline that the cursor is on a new line (helps keep display consistent).

rl_replace_line: Replaces the current input line buffer with a given string.

rl_redisplay: Redraws the current input line on the terminal.

add_history: Adds a line to the input history (so it can be recalled later with ↑).

👉 These work together: readline gathers input, you can add_history to save it, and functions like rl_replace_line or rl_redisplay manipulate what the user sees.

## **Standard I/O and Memory**

printf: Prints formatted output to stdout.

malloc: Allocates memory dynamically.

free: Frees memory previously allocated by malloc.

write: Low-level function to write raw data to a file descriptor.

👉 printf is built on top of write. malloc/free are often used to handle strings or buffers for I/O.

## **File and Process Management**

access: Checks if a file can be accessed with certain permissions.

open: Opens a file and returns a file descriptor.

read: Reads raw bytes from a file descriptor.

close: Closes a file descriptor.

👉 These form the basic workflow: check existence (access), open it, read or write, then close.

## **Process Control**

fork: Creates a new process (child is a copy of the parent).

wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4: Wait for child processes to change state (exit, stop, etc.).

execve: Replaces the current process image with a new program.

exit: Terminates the current process with a status code.

kill: Sends a signal to a process.

👉 Typical flow: fork → child calls execve to run another program → parent calls wait/waitpid to monitor it. kill is used to control processes via signals.

## **Signals**

signal: Assigns a handler for a given signal (simpler but less portable).

sigaction: More powerful, preferred way to define signal handlers.

sigemptyset: Initializes an empty signal set.

sigaddset: Adds a signal to a signal set.

👉 Used for handling events like Ctrl-C (SIGINT). sigaction replaces signal for robust control.

## **File System Info**

getcwd: Gets current working directory.

chdir: Changes working directory.

stat, lstat, fstat: Get file metadata (permissions, size, timestamps).

unlink: Removes a file (like rm).

👉 Often used together to implement shell-like behavior (cd, ls -l, rm).

## **File Descriptors and Pipes**

dup: Duplicates a file descriptor.

dup2: Duplicates one descriptor into another specific one.

pipe: Creates a pair of file descriptors for inter-process communication (read/write ends).

👉 Shells use these for redirection and pipelines (ls | grep foo).

## **Directories**

opendir: Opens a directory stream.

readdir: Reads entries in a directory (like ls).

closedir: Closes the directory stream.

## **Error Handling**

strerror: Returns human-readable string for an error code (errno).

perror: Prints the last error message automatically with context.

## **Terminal and TTY**

isatty: Checks if a file descriptor is a terminal.

ttyname: Gets the name of the terminal device.

ttyslot: Returns the slot number of the terminal in the utmp file.

ioctl: Generic interface to control device parameters (often terminals).

👉 Useful for programs that behave differently when run interactively vs piped.

## **Environment**

getenv: Fetches the value of an environment variable (like $PATH).

Terminal Attributes (termios)

tcsetattr: Sets terminal attributes (echo, raw mode, etc.).

tcgetattr: Gets current terminal attributes.

Termcap (legacy terminal control)

tgetent: Loads terminal entry from termcap database.

tgetflag: Gets a boolean capability (e.g., terminal supports auto-wrap).

tgetnum: Gets numeric capability (e.g., number of columns).

tgetstr: Gets string capability (e.g., clear screen sequence).

tgoto: Computes cursor movement escape sequence.

tputs: Outputs a control string to the terminal with padding.

👉 These functions are used for low-level terminal control (before curses/ncurses). They relate closely to readline which builds on terminal capabilities.


## **How They Correlate**

Readline + History: Provides user-friendly input handling, built on top of terminal/termcap.

Standard I/O + Syscalls: printf, malloc/free manage data; read, write, open, close are the low-level building blocks.

Processes + Signals: fork, execve, wait*, and kill are the backbone of process management. Signals (sigaction) integrate with them.

File system + Directories: stat, lstat, fstat, opendir/readdir/closedir handle filesystem operations.

Terminal Control: isatty, ioctl, tcsetattr/tcgetattr, and termcap functions allow fine-grained terminal interaction.


In short:

Shells (like bash) use almost all of these:

readline for input

add_history to remember commands

fork + execve to run programs

waitpid to manage them

dup2 + pipe for redirection/pipelines

stat, opendir for file operations

isatty, tcsetattr, tgetstr for terminal handling

# Question:

## Do we have to handle scripts? 
I refer to bash alike scripts that can be read as programs in our shell.
Do we have to handle cross reference to other shell As in should we be able to jump from one shell to the other? Is this even a topic per se?
